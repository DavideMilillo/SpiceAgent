# SpiceAgent
LTSpice AI-agent for circuit and electronic simulation. Use the power of AI in LTSpice

#first experiment: PyLTSpice
try PyLTSpice to connect python code to LTSpice program

#second experiment: PowerAgent
Use a simple LLM to analyze the netlist and create a circuit_description.md to summarize the circuit, highlighting the controlled variables of the circuit


#third experiment: PowerAgent: Buck converter
create the real AI-agent that should optimize the circuit parameters
