### SpiceAgent
LTSpice AI-agent for circuit and electronic simulation. 
Use the power of AI in LTSpice

## first experiment: PyLTSpice done 19Dec
Try PyLTSpice to connect python code to LTSpice program

## second experiment: Baby_SpiceAgent: done 19Dec
Use a simple LLM to analyze the netlist 
Then use the LLM to optimize the circuit
I tryed on a simple RC circuit to change the tau constant


## third experiment: PowerAgent: Buck converter
create the real AI-agent that should optimize the circuit parameters of a Buck converter
